Installing QuikWiki
-------------------


QuikWiki is a simple Wiki that provides, in addition to editing,
saving, and browsing Wiki pages, inline JPEG and GIF image display,
version control for edited pages, and embedded Perl scripts.


Requirements.

Apache with mod_perl.  QuikWiki is untested with other HTTP servers,
but I've attempted to keep the code close to plain HTTP and CGI, so it
should work with other Web servers that can run Perl CGI scripts,
though it's untested.

Perl. Also pod2html, if you want to view the view the manual on-line.
If you don't have pod2html, you probably don't have a complete Perl
installation.  Complain to your system administrator.

RCS, optionally, if you want QuikWiki to keep track of revisions.  If
you don't have RCS or don't want to use it, QuikWiki will make copies
of edited pages by adding a .bak extension.


Quick Install

   [If the quick install doesn't work for some reason, go to the
   "Manual Install" section, below.]

1. Unpack the tar file in the htdocs directory, your ~/public_html
   directory, or the directory named by the "ServerRoot" directive 
   in httpd.conf.  QuikWiki should also work in any 
   server-accessible directory that has "Options ExecCGI" enabled in 
   httpd.conf.

2. Change to the quikwiki directory and run the configuration
   script.  Configure will ask you if you want to create a directory 
   to contain old revisions of pages, and the user ID for the
   QuikWiki files and directories.  If installing in <ServerRoot>, 
   you'll need to have write permissions there (e.g., you're the 
   administrator).

     # cd quickwiki
     # perl configure   

That's it!  Browse to the HomePage by typing, in your Web browser,

   http://<server_address>/quikwiki/quikwiki.cgi

Or, althernately,

   http://<server_address>/quikwiki/

Or if you installed QuikWiki in your public_html directory,

   http://<server_address>/~<your_user_name>/quikwiki/quikwiki.cgi

Substituting the actual network address of the server for
<server_address>, and your actual user name for <your_user_name>.

If you don't see a Revision number or Last Modified date/time
in the page footer, edit and then save the page to create the 
RCS repository.

Manual Install

1. Unpack the tar file in the htdocs directory, or the
   directory named by the "ServerRoot" directive in the httpd.conf
   file.  QuikWiki should also work in your ~/public_html directory
   if "Options ExecCGI" in httpd.conf is enabled for the directory.

2. Make quikwiki.cgi executable with the shell command:

     chmod +x quikwiki/quikwiki.cgi

3. (Optional)  If you want to use RCS to manage revisions,
   create a quikwiki/RCS subdirectory.

     mkdir quikwiki/RCS

4. You can omit the script name if "DirectoryIndex index.cgi" is in 
   the httpd.conf file.  You'll need to symlink quikwiki.cgi to 
   index.cgi:

     cd quikwiki
     ln -s quikwiki.cgi index.cgi

5. Make sure that Apache can read and write the files.  The
   directories and files need to be owned by the same user as 
   the HTTPD server process, or the owner of ~/public_html.  
   The example uses "apache," but you should use the user name 
   in the "User" http.conf directive if installing system-wide.

     cd ..
     chown -R apache quikwiki

   Or even better, make the files and directories group-writeable.
