Installing QuikWiki
-------------------


QuikWiki is a simple Wiki that provides, in addition to editing,
saving, and browsing Wiki pages, inline JPEG and GIF image display,
version control for edited pages, and embedded Perl page templates.


Requirements.

Apache with mod_perl.  QuikWiki is untested with other HTTP servers.
The program tries to adhere to generic HTTP and CGI protocols.  QuikWiki
should work with other Web servers that can run Perl CGI scripts,
although it's untested.

Perl. Also pod2html, if you want to view the view the manual on-line.
Pod2html is part of the Perl source code distribution.  If you don't
have pod2html, consult your system administrator.

Optionally, Revision Control System, if you want QuikWiki to keep
track of revisions.  Without RCS, QuikWiki makes backup copies of
edited pages by adding a ".bak" extension.


Quick Install

   [If the quick install doesn't work for some reason, which is 
   entirely possible because of the wide variety of Web server 
   configuration, go to the, "Manual Install," section, below.]

1. Unpack the tar file in your ~/public_html subdirectory, or, 
   the subdirectory named by the, "DocumentRoot," directive 
   in httpd.conf.  The latter should be, "htdocs," if you built 
   and installed Apache from the source code distribution.  
   QuikWiki should also work in any server-accessible directory 
   that has, "Options ExecCGI," enabled in httpd.conf or a 
   .htaccess file.

   If upgrading, make sure to back up the directory.

2. Change to the quikwiki directory and run the configuration
   script.  Configure will ask if you want to create a directory 
   to contain old revisions of pages, and the user ID for the
   QuikWiki files and directories.  If you're installing quikwiki 
   in <DocumentRoot>, you'll need to have write permissions in that
   directory (i.e., you're the administrator).

     # cd quickwiki-<version>
     # perl configure   

That's it!  (Or, that should be it.) Browse to the HomePage by typing,
in your Web browser,

   http://<server_address>/quikwiki/quikwiki.cgi

Or, alternately,

   http://<server_address>/quikwiki/

If you installed QuikWiki in your ~/public_html directory,

   http://<server_address>/~<your_user_name>/quikwiki/quikwiki.cgi

Substituting the actual network address of the server for
<server_address>, and your actual user name for <your_user_name>.

If using RCS, and you don't see a Revision number or Last Modified
date/time in the page footer, edit and then save the page to create
the RCS repository.  If you have trouble saving the revision, 
double-check the permissions of the page, the RCS subdirectory, 
and the RCS archive.

To view QuikWiki's Perl Online Documentation, browse to:

    http://<server_address>/quikwiki/quikwiki.cgi?doc

or click on the, "doc," link in the page header.


Manual Install

1. Unpack the tar file in the htdocs directory, or the directory 
   named by the "DocumentRoot" directive in the httpd.conf file.  
   QuikWiki should also work in your ~/public_html directory if 
   "Options ExecCGI" in httpd.conf is enabled for the directory.

2. Make quikwiki.cgi executable with the shell command:

     chmod +x quikwiki/quikwiki.cgi

3. (Optional)  If you want to use RCS to manage revisions,
   create a quikwiki/RCS subdirectory.

     mkdir quikwiki/RCS

4. You can omit the script name if "DirectoryIndex index.cgi" is set 
   in httpd.conf or the directory's .htaccess file.  You'll need to 
   symlink quikwiki.cgi to index.cgi:

     cd quikwiki-<version>
     ln -s quikwiki.cgi index.cgi

5. Make sure that Apache can read and write the files.  The
   directories and files need to be owned by the same user as 
   the HTTPD server process or the owner of ~/public_html.  This 
   example uses, "apache," but the owner should be the user 
   named in the, "User," http.conf directive if installing 
   system-wide.

     cd ..
     chown -R apache quikwiki

   Or even better, make the files and directories group-writable.

   If you have trouble saving page revisions, double check the 
   ownership and permissions of the quikwiki and RCS subdirectories,
   the page itself, and the RCS archive.

Licensing

  Quikwiki is free software.  You can modify and distribute QuikWiki
  using the same licensing terms as Perl itself.  Consult the file 
  "Artistic" for details.
